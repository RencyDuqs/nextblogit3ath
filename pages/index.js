          <h3 align="center">1.  Why did you take up IT?</h3>
          <p>I took up IT because I was interested in the industry and I was interested in IT because of the influence of my uncle and the modernization of the world. I thought that this would be something that could help my life and also the life of others. I wanted to become an IT professional so that I can develop different programs and systems that could benefit us users. </p>

          <hr></hr>

          <p>As of right now I will be honest I don't know what I will be when i graduate. I am currently still exploring my options, but becoming a frontend developer is not a bad idea if I think about it but I am also interested in being a flexible developer of sorts. Generally I just want to help produce different programs or systems that would make the life of others including myself easier which in time hopefully comes true.</p>
