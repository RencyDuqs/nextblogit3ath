        <p>[Hello I am Rency. I am a Student in BSIT]</p>
        <p>I am Rency Dayne M. Duque. I am from Jose Abad Santos Guagua.Pampanga. I enjoy lots of things such as  playing badminton or playing the guitar. I enjoy playing rock, indie or even classical music sometimes. One of my favorite foods is chicken adobo along with rice. I also love watching different films or videos online that can keep me entertained.
